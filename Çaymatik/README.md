## Air Piano Project Details
With the development of electronic technology, musical instruments that are difficult to produce, expensive and producing high-quality sound have been digitized. Pianos are one of these instruments. Each key of digital pianos produces electrical signals at a different frequency. Thus, it can play 88 different notes from its speakers. Factors such as the delay time of the keys of digital instruments, the quality of the speaker, the resolution of the sound have appeared as the factors affecting the quality. In electric guitars, vibrations in strings are digitized instead of keys. On the other hand, In wind instruments, the notes played can be converted into electrical signals and recorded thanks to the high-resolution microphones plugged into the sound output. This development in electronic technology has facilitated access to high-cost musical instruments, music education has gained a wider variety and spread to a wider audience.
